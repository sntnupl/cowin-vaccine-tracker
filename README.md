# Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker (India)

This is a small console application, written in C#, to track availability of Covid-19 vaccines in India.  
It uses the Cowin Open APIs, Spec available [at this link](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin).

You need to install dotnet core SDK in your machine. For details on how to install and use dotnet core, [visit this link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

**Check vaccine availability in your district:**  
1. `dotnet run -- checkvaccineslots byDistrict -s karnataka -d bbmp -a 18 -w 4`
   - here we are checking vaccine availability in BBMP district of Karnataka, for ages 18 and above, in next 4 weeks.
1. `dotnet run -- checkvaccineslots byDistrict -s karnataka -d bbmp -a 18 -w 4 -c`
   - same as above, but here the command will be *continuously* checking (until user presses `ctrl+c`).


**Check vaccine availability by PIN Code:**  
1. `dotnet run -- checkvaccineslots byPin -p 560001 -a 45 -w 4`
   - here we are checking vaccine availability in Pin Code `560001`, for ages 18 and above, in next 4 weeks.
   - add `-c` to keep the checks running continuously (until user presses `ctrl+c`).


**Get names and IDs of all the districts in a state:**  
1. `dotnet run -- getdistrictid bystate -s "West Bengal"`


## Getting started from pre-built exe file
